# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      title: 'The Leadership Model'
      body: |
        1. As a member of the SCS you are a leader of your organisation. Your
          performance will be assessed by not only what you have achieved, but
          how you have achieved it.
        2. You will be expected to demonstrate the behaviours in the Leadership
          Model when achieving your objectives.

        # Set Future Direction

        Leaders need to paint a picture of the future which is compelling and
        will galvanise commitment and action; in doing this they must identify
        the strategic context and set a clear direction.

        # Manage Effectively and Deliver Results

        Leaders are responsible for challenging and supporting their teams to
        deliver excellence across all our business plan commitments.

        Leaders need to manage within tight fiscal constraints and should
        encourage new and innovative ways to deliver those commitments.

        Leaders need to ensure their teams collaborate across the service,
        utilising strong project management disciplines to ensure delivery of
        work to time and budget.

        Leaders must ensure a culture of performance management at all levels:
        individual, team and organisation.

        # Engage People and Develop Capability

        Leaders need to harness the ideas and energy of our people and our
        stakeholders, especially during this significant period of change and
        reform.

        Leaders need to create a culture of continuous organisational
        improvement, through feedback and learning.

        Leaders need to encourage and provide opportunities for individuals to
        grow, ensuring our rich mix of skills and experience is properly
        developed and deployed.

        Leaders also need to develop their own capability and demonstrate self
        awareness, confidence and resilience.

        # Live Our Values

        Leaders must demonstrate themselves, and embed in their teams the
        statutory Civil Service values: honesty, integrity, impartiality and
        objectivity.

        Working together to build a safe and just society

        # What we do

        We serve the public by upholding the rule of law, and by delivering an
        efficient, fair, timely and effective justice system in which the
        public has confidence.

        * We enforce the decisions of the court: we punish offenders and work
          to reduce reoffending. We prevent victims by changing lives.
        * In partnership with an independent judiciary, we run the courts and
          tribunals service, helping individuals, businesses and families
          resolve their disputes.
        * We protect vulnerable members of society and children, and help to
          ensure victims of crime get justice.
        * We provide legal aid and advice for those cases where it is
          justified.
        * We develop policy on all aspects of law and justice, both
          domestically and internationally, helping to build a legal and rights
          framework that is clear and proportionate and that commands
          confidence around the world.

        # Transforming our services

        We are transforming and modernising our services, through five priority
        programmes to:

        1. Transform Rehabilitation by opening up rehabilitation services to
          the innovation of the private and voluntary sector, in order to reduce
          reoffending.
        2. Reform the prison system to create a fit-for-purpose, modern estate
          which provides accommodation at a much lower cost to the taxpayer.
        3. Transform Youth Custody, driving down the cost and helping to make
          sure young offenders are equipped for a life away from crime.
        4. Transform the Criminal Justice System and the courts, making them
          more flexible and efficient.
        5. Create a sustainable Legal Aid system which is more affordable and
          more effective.

        # How we work

        We need to keep improving our services and the way we work so that we
        can best serve the public, meet new challenges, deliver value for the
        taxpayer and make MoJ a great place to work. We expect everyone across
        the organisation to:

        * Understand their role and play their part in delivering the MoJ
          story.
        * Take responsibility for their own development, building the skills
          they need to deliver improved performance.
        * Innovate and work at pace to improve all of our policies and
          services.
        * Manage risk effectively and deliver better value for money.
        * Know what good leadership looks like and continually improve their
          own leadership skills.
        * Break down silos and work together collaboratively to deliver better
          justice outcomes.
        * Involve all staff in managing change.
